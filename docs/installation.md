# Installation

**Requirements**:

* Ensure that you have PostgreSQL utilities preinstalled on your system, with the same **major version**
  as your destination server.

* If you are building Greenmask from source, make sure you have the "make" utility installed.

## From Source:

* Begin by cloning the Greenmask repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GreenmaskIO/greenmask.git
```

* Once the repository is cloned, execute the following command to build Greenmask:

```bash
make build
```

* After completing the build process, you will find the binary named `greenmask` located in the root directory
  of the repository.
